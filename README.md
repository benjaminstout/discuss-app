# [Discuss.IO App](https://benjaminstout.github.io/discuss-app/)
A quick web app I coded for an application with the folks over at [Discuss.io](https://www.discuss.io/)

This is a web app to manage candidate screen questions, and as required of [the guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PPcWOMoSTQ44QChekso2woKBy4oW8bN6-HhOFrYJzHE/edit), supports:
-  adding/removing/editing of screening questions
-  defining the question (text area)
-  editing/deleting answers and options
-  saving (locally) a current state of the question
-  checkboxes as mentioned in the [video clip](https://drive.google.com/a/discuss.io/file/d/0B264QEF9ZB3mcFJzMkpXWmRyZlk/view?usp=sharing)
-  dragging/dropping of questions

Designed and built entirely from scratch by yours truly. It features a fully-responsive, simplistic design utilizing the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/).
